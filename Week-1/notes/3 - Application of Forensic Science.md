Case: Walter Dinivan
Year: 1939
Place: Bournemouth, England
Walter was a wealthy man (64 years old)
His head has been found bashed and his skull was crushed.
He was rushed to hospital, but he died unconsciously.

What did cops found?
1. Safe abd pockets were emptied
-- Robbery
2. Crumpled up brown paper bag
-- That helped the murderer not keep any fingerprints
3. Cigarette butts on the floor
-- Prediction: Friends?? Were they actually talking to eachother which led to argument and murder maybe?

Investigation:
Suspects:
Joseph Williams --> a poor man who suddenly happened to have more money after Walter's dead.

Few years ago, an interesting discovery had been made.
-- Using saliva that can determine the blood group of a person.

Using new technology,
cigarette butts --> Saliva --> Test the blood group --> AB-type blood (rare)

How did they get Joseph Williams into it?
Cops (Police) followed him into the pub,
--- Bought him beer + gave him cigarettes
--- Collected glasses & cigarette ends
--- Extracted saliva
--- Analyzed blood group as AB
With strong evidence, Joseph was arrested.

Defense said:- Blood is just Blood and Saliva is just a spit.
In those period, the forensic science was not believed nor taken serious.

Joseph walked out free though he was the murderer.

Later, Joseph confessed to a journalist while drunk, but there were no witnesses and so, it went came in public.
It was published after Joseph's death.

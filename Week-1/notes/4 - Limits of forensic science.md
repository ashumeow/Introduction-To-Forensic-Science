What is Forensics?
Forensics is defined as the application of science to Law.
But, Law appears to be a broad term because it includes civil law and commercial law where it's no application to forensics.
So, To easily define:-
Forensics is defined as the application of science to criminal justice in the analysis of Physical, Chemical and biological evidences from crime scence or elsewhere.

In notes-1 (Introduction), we discussed the difference between Forensic science and Forensic medicine.

Features of Forensic Science:
1. Ability in reconstructung past sequence of events.
Examples:- Suspects in aspects of fibres, hair, blood, fingerprints, shoeprints, broken glass, paint flakes
2. Ability of linking a suspect to a crime scene.

Another case:
Bukit Merah, Singapore, 1972,
Bukit Merah train tracks -- the line that links Malaysia and Singapore
-- The train ran over a boy.

Question: Was it a suicide attempt by the boy? (or) Was it an accident?

Forensics medicine specialist analyzed that the body had inconsistent injuries which it's termed as blood spatter.

Blood spatter:
Living body --> Pressurized arteries
Several artery --> Blood will spurt out in considerable quantities
Dead body --> Arteries not pressurized and Lesser blood will spurt out

It was found that too little blood was there in the body,
which means that a dead body was put on the train tracks.

Police investigation:
The poor boy was murdered (for having few dollars in his pocket).
Then, he was put on train track letting the train run on me making it look like suicide or accident.
The murderer was finally caught and convicted.

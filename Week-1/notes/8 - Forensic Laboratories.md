In Singapore,
Chao Tzee Cheng setup Pathology lab in 1960s
Before that in 1929, a chemical analysis service available from straits settlements police.
Nowadays, it's all in control of Health Sciences Authority.

-- Can we scientifically detect a lie?
Mostly, they don't believe these results.

Voiceprint analysis
-- Proving that a voice belongs to a particular person

Psychiatric profiling
-- What can we tell about the criminal from the way they commit the crime?

-- Specialization who are specialized in forensics

Forensic Entomology
-- Using insects to provide information.

Forensics Geology
-- Soil analysis:- Mineral content

Forensic Anthropology
-- Analysis of skeletal remains
-- Skeletal remains
1. when people die in remote places
2. Body found after decomposed

Facial Reconstruction
-- Taking skull and re-build flesh
1. See how the person looked like when they were aive
-- How it's done?
1. modelling clay
2. nowadays, it can be done electronically

Forensic Odontology
-- Using teeth to provide information
1. Identification of victim remains
2. Identification of criminals

How did they know?
Based upon scientific principles of forensic science, they will have "strong evidence".
It's the interpretation of the evidence where it's found at,
1. crime scene,
2. physical objects or measurements

More than just interpretation, it is all about the reliability of evidence on,
1. how it can be trusted through understanding,
2. To what extent it can be trusted,
3. Reliability of DNA

Also, evidence that can be deduced and those that can not be deduced,
1. Some aspects are beyond the power of forensic science,
2. There are limits in forensic science.

Forensic science uses almost all philosophy of science where it is done through observations and experiments.
Through observations and experiments, we come to an theory that provides explanation which could later go back to further observations and experiments.
When the theory is robust, then it's well and good.

As the theory gets powerful, then scientists tend to write scientific papers and present them at conferences.
Well, this is for normal scientists.

As for forensic scientists, when the theory is strong, then,
1. Presenting theory in court
2. Expert witness
3. Convincing judge/jury
If the theory is wrong, then there is serious consequences because you will be sending an innocent person to prison/death.

Procedures in a case:
1. Evidence from: Experts, Witness, Police
2. Prosecution vs Defense
3. Verdict

The verdict is given by,
System 1. Judge => the final decision (most followed system)
System 2. Jury => decision through whether the person is guilty or not through local citizens.

Presumption of innocence:
1. Innocent until proven guilty
2. Prosecution has to prove guilt
3. Defense does not have to prove innocence

Case: Felicia Lee
-- Living together with her boyfriend (Randone)
-- On September 11th 2009, Her boyfriend Made 911 emergency call and said she was dead.
-- Felicia was sent for autopsy
-- Autopsy results: Over 300 "blunt force trauma wounds".
-- Randone was charged for murder as well as for the torture.

How Felicia died?
(i) Prosecution
(ii) Torture: Kicked by Randone
(iii) Cause of death: Asphyxia by smothering

Autopsy results -- cycle:
(a) Standard tests -> For checking other possibilities causing death
(b) Blood chemistry -> Felicia's blood was found to contain gamma-hydroxybutyrate(GHB) which was a drug.

On analyzing the drug, the expert witness was brought-in and proved that she died due to drug overdose and seizure.

Case results: Randone was proved as an innocent since Felicia died due to drug overdose.

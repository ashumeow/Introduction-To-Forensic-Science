Case: Robert Calvi (Italian banker)
During 1980s...
Murder or Suicide?
-- Banco Ambrosiano
-- "God's banker"
-- U.S.$1.2 billion missing

What happened?
-- Disappeared from Milan, Italy on June 11th
-- Hanged under Blackfriars Bridge, London on June 19th

Then.. What had he done?
-- Got a false passport
-- Shaved his moustache
-- Adopted a false name
-- Escaped to London

It could have been suicide...
-- Unable to answer for the missing money
-- Unable to escape

But, Roberto's son was convinced that Roberto did "not" commit suicide.

First inquest --> suicide...

Then... Second inquest was made..

While Roberto was hanging from the bridge, the police found..
1. Bricks in suit pocket --> For drowning... but he was hanging..
2. U.S.$14,000 in wallet
3. False passport -> opporunity to travel?
4. Bags packed when checked-in hotel -> Going to travel?

Pathology:
1. Neck not broken
2. No drugs in blood
3. No signs of a struggle
4. No water in lungs --> So, not drowned!
5. Watch stopped at 1.52am

Environment...
-- Blackfriars bridge was under-maintainence during that time
-- It was surrounded by yellow painted scaffolding
-- Whenever climbing up and down, it's possible to get yellow paint flakes and rust marks on clothes or body.

So.. Roberto:
-- did not have such paint falkes
-- did not have rust marks
So, there is no climb down the scaffolding.
But, there could be the possibility that he was raised up to the scaffolding.

Questions?
1. Why a rope and bricks?
2. Where did he get the rope? The polices couldn't find the details.
3. Why no paint flakes on him? How did he manage to climb up the scaffolding without paint flakes on him?
4. Why to commit suicide on a cold dirty river, but not the comfortable hotel he already booked?
5. How did he travel from hotel (West-London, Chelsea) to bridge (East-London)? Why to travel this far? There are already plenty of bridges in West London, right?

Enquiries were made with bus & taxi drivers, but nobody had seen him that night.

Finally...
-- It was not a suicide.
-- Likely to have been murdered.
-- No sufficient evidence to convict anyone.
It still remained as an unsolved mystery of who actually did it.

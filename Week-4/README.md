"Much like fingerprints, every human being's DNA is unique to them - a fact which has revolutionised forensic science."

- Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, Professor of Genetics at Leicester University, pioneer of genetic fingerprinting and DNA profiling.

Learning Objective(s)
```
At the end of this topic, you should be able to:

Describe the nature of DNA;
List the various techniques used in DNA profiling;
Explain how DNA technology is used in paternity and maternity testing;
Summarize how DNA technology has facilitated police work.
```
Synopsis
```
An introduction to DNA and the techniques used in DNA fingerprinting, including Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), Gel Electrophoresis and Capillary Gel Electrophoresis. 
There will also be a discussion of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which allows very small traces of DNA to be multiplied. 
Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) will be introduced, and there will be a review of how STRs can be used in paternity and maternity testing when combined with capillary gel electrophoresis. 
Comparisons of nuclear DNA with mitochondrial DNA will also be carried out. 
Several cold cases and how they were solved using DNA technology and DNA databases will be examined. 
There will also be case studies throughout the lecture to illustrate the techniques and concepts taught.

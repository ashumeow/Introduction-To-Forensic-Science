Synopsis
```
3A. Time of Death

Physiological changes in the body after death will be surveyed, and concepts such as Algor Mortis, Rigor Mortis, and Livor Mortis will be introduced. 
There will also be a discussion on putrefaction and how forensic entomology can be applied to forensic science. 
Techniques used for dating fresh and old bones will be examined. 
Case studies will be used to demonstrate the application of the techniques and concepts taught in this lecture.

3B. Blood

Blood chemistry and the scientific basis of blood typing will be discussed. 
There will also be a review of the tests which can be carried out to identify and individualise blood. 
Blood spatter patterns and the deduction of information from the types of spatter patterns will be examined. 
Several case studies will be used to illustrate the concepts and techniques taught in the lecture.
